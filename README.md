# esx_shops_by_model

The most simple barebones easier to make model mapped shops script I could come up with.
Uses ox inventory. I thought vending machines were supposed to work out of the box with ox inventory + ox target but they didn't... at least for me, so I just went with this, as I don't much care for targeting scripts anyway.
